## Chess

ChessApp is a full-stack application that allows players to play Chess against a friend on the same computer when offline, or play against another player connected to the server. The server was created using Express.js while the front-end was created using the ReactJs framework. ChessApp utilises sessions to save the user's session so they do not need to enter their name when connecting to the server. Furthermore, socket.io is used to carry user chess movers to opponents, facilitating an online experience.

## ChatApp

ChatApp is a full-stack CRUD application that enables all users in the server to send messages to one another in a chat room. The backend application was created using the Java Spring Boot Framework, while the front end was developed using the ReactJs framework. Furthermore, JSON Web Tokens are utilised within the application to provide security when the user creates their accounts and authenticates themselves as their created account. Users can also update and delete their account details. The server also stores information on a database using MongoDB atlas.


To run either of the above applications, start the server then run npm start in the directory of the client directories.

## Cards

Cards is a game developed using Python and Pygame, a set of modules designed for creating video games. The game is based on the card game "Thirteens" and consists of the user playing against an AI bot that utilises the Minimax algorithm. To run this game, the only dependency required is pygame.
