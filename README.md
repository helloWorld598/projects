## Chess

ChessApp is a full-stack application that allows players to play Chess against a friend on the same computer when offline, or play against another player connected to the server. The server was created using Express.js while the front-end was created using the ReactJs framework. ChessApp utilises sessions to save the user's session so they do not need to enter their name when connecting to the server. Furthermore, socket.io is used to carry user chess movers to opponents, facilitating an online experience.

## ChatApp

ChatApp is a full-stack CRUD application that enables all users in the server to send messages to one another in a chat room. Users are also able to send individual messages to users. The backend application was created using the Java Spring Boot Framework, while the front end was developed using the ReactJs framework. Furthermore, JSON Web Tokens are utilised within the application for authentication and to provide security to users. The server also stores information on a database using MongoDB atlas.
